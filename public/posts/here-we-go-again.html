	<h1>Here we go again</h1>
<p>Consistency is a tricky subject, and many of us fall short of it. I'm no exception; often, I find myself wanting to do more than I can realistically achieve. This isn't inherently bad; it shows that I have a strong drive in various subjects. However, the issue arises from the fact that this drive to do more often results in me accomplishing less in the long run. Having my days fully packed leaves me with no room to &quot;decompress&quot;, if that concept even exists. Moreover, it significantly affects my creativity since most of my best ideas come to me when I'm idling, walking, or performing menial chores.</p>
<p>Despite being aware of all this, I still find it challenging to avoid overcommitting. This difficulty illustrates how hard it is to change certain habits that have become ingrained in my mind, and I accepted as absolute truths. Lately, I've been successful in reducing the number of tasks I assign to myself, but this change comes with the side effect of feeling like I haven't done enough when, in reality, I have. This is something I need to work on.</p>
<p>In the end, it's all about time and discipline. I believe that I will emerge from this experience as a better engineer, a better human, and a better husband. Just like in many good tales, there must be a fall for a rise to occur; life is full of such ups and downs. Realizations like this emphasize the importance of self-reflection.</p>
<p>One valuable lesson I've gained from this experience, that of being human, is recognizing how frequently I deceive myself. Habits do not change in a week, a month, or even a year; many of them are deeply ingrained in my brain. This realization is hard to accept because it shows that my limitations are self-imposed, not imposed by anyone else. I won't overcome these limitations until I stop self-deception and accept that it takes time. The past two months have been dedicated to this, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the journey. Nevertheless, the feeling of not having accomplished much still lingers and won't disappear easily. I'm on the right path; I just need to ensure I don't get sidetracked by my past self.</p>
<p>Today's society, with its emphasis on immediacy, does not help either. I was born in a time and place where personal computers were mainstream, and many households had one. While this brought me many opportunities, a career, friendships, and a sense of community, it also came with its own set of trade-offs. <em>It's important to note that this article is based on my personal experiences and opinions about specific topics.</em> Don't want to get the typical dummy telling me to go live like the Amish.</p>
<p>The more I allow technology into my life, the more disconnected I feel from it. This may be because I misuse it and lack the discipline to know when to stop, but its primary goal is to keep me engaged. So, I have the choice to constantly battle with myself or learn to live without it. I choose the latter. It can get messy at times because most of my inner circle uses those applications to stay connected, and occasionally, I feel out of the loop, which I've come to realize is not a big deal.</p>
<p>The benefits are evident, at least for me. Ultimately, it's not about rejecting technology but learning how to use it without letting it disrupt your life or divert you from what truly matters. Although I've eliminated most distractions, they have undoubtedly left an impact on me. As a result, I'm relearning the art of focusing on one thing at a time. When it's time to read, I read. When it's time to socialize, I socialize, and so on.</p>
<p>Please don't take this as advice; my sole intention, if you allow me, is to encourage you to reflect on your own life, your relationship with technology, your environment, and the society in which you live. If your life's pace permits, schedule some time to contemplate these matters and anything else that crosses your mind, without expecting any specific revelations. You're not going to find enlightenment here; that's a task for the smoke sellers. Do it because you want to, not because someone told you to.</p>
