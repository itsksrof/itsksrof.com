    <h1>About</h1>
<p>Hey! This is Kevin, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working mainly on stuff such as distributed systems, identity management, and developer experience. Through all of this years many technologies have passed through my hands but only a select few have found a place in my toolbox, yet I never say no to the possibility of exploring a new language, framework or tool as it helps me to keep my feet on the ground, and acknowledge the breadth of this field and the impossibleness of knowing it all.</p>
<p>Aside from my career I live to enjoy what really matters to me. Thus my rationale way of thinking is; first comes life, then comes work. Because in all honesty how can I be on top of my game, when my life is a train-wreck. So most of my time off-screen is devoted to reading, hiking and hopefully in the near future, playing an instrument.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it, I hope that this small brushstroke of how I am, and how I see things helps you to know me a bit better. Send me an email at <strong>itsksrof.contact</strong> at <strong>proton.me</strong> if you have any questions, want to chat, or if you want to buy me a beer.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
