# About
Hey! This is Kevin, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working mainly on stuff such as distributed systems, identity management, and developer experience. Through all of this years many technologies have passed through my hands but only a select few have found a place in my toolbox, yet I never say no to the possibility of exploring a new language, framework or tool as it helps me to keep my feet on the ground, and acknowledge the breadth of this field and the impossibleness of knowing it all.

Aside from my career I live to enjoy what really matters to me. Thus my rationale way of thinking is; first comes life, then comes work. Because in all honesty how can I be on top of my game, when my life is a train-wreck. So most of my time off-screen is devoted to reading, hiking and hopefully in the near future, playing an instrument.

That's pretty much it, I hope that this small brushstroke of how I am, and how I see things helps you to know me a bit better. Send me an email at **itsksrof.contact** at **proton.me** if you have any questions, want to chat, or if you want to buy me a beer.

Cheers!
- Kevin
